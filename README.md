Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository is a comprehensive resource for learning and implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms, essential for software development, coding interviews, and computational problem-solving.

What are Data Structures and Algorithms?

Data Structures: Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification.
Algorithms: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas used for calculations, data processing, and automated reasoning.
Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for writing efficient code, designing scalable systems, and solving complex problems in various domains of computer science and engineering.

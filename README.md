## 🌟 My Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository 🌟

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository is dedicated to solving various DSA problems, providing efficient solutions and explanations. Each day, I upload new problem solutions, focusing on a wide range of topics to enhance understanding and mastery of DSA concepts.

## 📚 About Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of computer science. They are essential for writing efficient and optimized code. Understanding DSA helps in solving complex problems, improving code performance, and preparing for technical interviews. This repository covers a comprehensive list of topics, each with well-documented solutions in **Java**.

## 🗂️ Topics Covered

This repository includes solutions for problems in the following areas:

- **Arrays**
- **Binary Search**
- **Binary Search Tree**
- **Binary Tree**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph**
- **Linked List**
- **Recursion**
- **Stack and Queue**
- **Greedy Algorithm**

More topics will be added in the future as I continue to expand this repository.

## 🛠️ Repository Structure

Each topic has its own directory, and within each directory, you'll find solutions to various problems related to that topic. The solutions are implemented in **Java** and are accompanied by explanations and comments to aid understanding.
